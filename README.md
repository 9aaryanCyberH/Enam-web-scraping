# ðŸŒ¾ eNAAM Crop Price Scraper

This project uses **Puppeteer** to scrape real-time crop prices from the official [eNAM](https://enam.gov.in/web/dashboard/live_price) website and provides an **Express API** to trigger the scraper and fetch the data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Scrapes real-time crop price data from eNAM dashboard.
- Stores the scraped data in a local JSON file (`enam_price_data.json`).
